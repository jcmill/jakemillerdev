###Notes:           
The initial version of this project, V1, was a fast, functional build 
developed within my Pug/SASS/JavaScript environment. I had established 
much of the core functionality, but the project was temporarily shelved 
after a career shift led me into a new role and responsibilities. 
Once things settled, I revisited the project with a fresh perspective 
and refined vision. This time, I chose to rebuild the site in React to 
better support scalability and to move to a more component-based 
architecture with the aim to control the entire site through one 
json file.

In that spirit, I broke my goals down into components—just as I would 
the UI itself. While V1 doesn’t represent a full MVP, it served as a 
thoughtful starting point for mapping out animations, layout patterns, 
and cross-browser functionality. (Yes, Firefox and Safari still keep 
things interesting.) For design inspiration, I returned to the 
fundamentals—revisiting design texts from college and drawing from the 
structured beauty of Constructivism, Bauhaus, and the grid systems of 
Vilmos Husár’s De Stijl work. Layered with my background in mathematics, 
I explored symmetry, number patterns, and the golden ratio to inform 
structure and visual balance throughout this build.
